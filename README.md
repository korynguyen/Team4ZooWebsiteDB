This project was created using ASP.Net. In order to run it locally, you must have Visual Studio installed on your computer.

To open up the project in Visual Studio open the file Team4ZooWebsiteDB.sln. 

If you dont have the required dependencies installed you should get a prompt from Visual Studios telling you to install ASP.Net and it will have a button to download required dependencies. 

If there was no prompt and you dont have ASP.Net installed. Open Visual Studio Installer (install it if not installed) and click on modify on your currently installed Visual Studio version then under Web & Cloud click the checkmark on "ASP.NET and web development" then click modify in the bottom right corner.

To start the project click on "IIS Express" with the green arrow on the toolbar on the top of Visual Studio.

If you get the error shown in error.png when trying to start the project, comment out line 4 in the corresponding file.
